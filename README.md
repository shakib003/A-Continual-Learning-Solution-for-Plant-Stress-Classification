*üå± "Optimizing CNN Memory Efficiency: A Continual Learning Solution for Plant Stress Classification"*



## ‚ú® Highlights
- Applying continual learning techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Learning without Forgetting (LwF) to CNN models, allowing them to continuously acquire new knowledge without losing previously acquired information.
- Dividing the dataset into tasks that simulate real-world scenarios of continuous data flow, enabling the evaluation of the proposed methods under conditions that mirror dynamic agricultural environments.
- Optimizing the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for multi-task classification, ensuring high accuracy across different plant stress detection tasks while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting typically associated with re-training large models for each new task.
